    <p>Michelle does a great job of understanding what you really want and getting your vision. <br> There are a lot of so-called designers in Dallas. Most of them just decorate. There is a difference. If you get her in a project where a contractor is involved, keep her engaged in the whole thing.  <br>You will be glad you did.
